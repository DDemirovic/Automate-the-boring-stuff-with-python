					Chapter 2
1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
-True, False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
-and, or, not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
-nö

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)				-False
not (5 > 4)						-False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)				-True			
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))			-False
(True and True) and (True == False)		-False
(not False) or (not True)			-True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
- <, <=, >, >=, ==, =!

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
-Equal (==) vergleicht, assignment (=) weist Werte zu

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
- if tomorrow = rain
	take umbrella

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')

if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')

print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
-Done

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
ctrl + c = infinite loop stop (sorgt für "KeyboardInterrupt"

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
-break beendet die Methode (Schleife bspw.), continue skippt den Rest im Block und springt zum Anfang zurück

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
range(10) = iteration bis 10
range(0, 10) = iteration von 0 bis 10
range(0, 10, 1) = iteration von 0 bis 10 in 1er Schritten (range(START, ENDE, SCHRITTWEITE)

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
-Done

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
import spam
spam.bacon()
